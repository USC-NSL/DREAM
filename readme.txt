This document explains how to use the code developed for the system called DREAM. 
The description of DREAM is published in "DREAM: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Software-defined Measurement” in SIGCOMM’14. 
Note that this system is just developed to test the academic idea of resource allocation for software defined measurement and 
its implementation can be far from a real-world commercial implementation in terms of coding standards, reliability, and performance. 
Therefore please use it at your risk. 

Finally please refer to the following paper if you use the code in any publication:
Masoud Moshref, Minlan Yu, Ramesh Govindan, Amin Vahdat "DREAM: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Software-defined Measurement", SIGCOMM, Chicago, 2014
